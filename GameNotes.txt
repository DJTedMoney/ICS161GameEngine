Need to make a few subclasses of Actor:


TriggerPoint

Character:
	Enemy - will be a zergling and a boss
	Player













Structure

Game loop:

Main -> Game().init()-> Game().update() -> Game.draw()

//Init() - This is where you initialize anything you need for later use.
//Load anything/do SDL stuff here

//update() - The heart of your code goes here. Move positions, play sounds, ect

//draw() - set up any drawing to screen here
